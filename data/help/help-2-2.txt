<h1>Equipment, Eyes</h1>

This context provides the possibility to equip the character with eyes.
<p>
<i>The character is equipped with highpoly-eyes per default. The mesh can be
changed. But in most cases, this context would be used to change the eye-color.</i>
<p>
The currently selected eyes are marked with a yellow frame. A green frame means, that the eyes are used.
<p>
<h3>Filtering</h3>
As long as tags are provided, eyes can be filtered in numerous ways. Eyes with no tags are always
shown.  These are the possibilities to filter  on the left side:
<ul>
<li>By expanding the items, like <b>Mode</b>, then select a mode. The top-level items (at the moment <b>Mode</b> only) work like 'and'. Sublayers
are combined with 'or'.
<p>
<li>By using a text filter, the text filter works on all tags presented in the <b>Tags</b> field after eyes are selected.
</ul>
<p>
Hint: If the program shows too many items on right side, it is possible to supply eyes
with extra tags, these tags are then used instead of the tags provided in the eyes files.
<p>
<h3>Loading</h3>

Select eyes from the right side. Be aware it is not yet loaded, only the information is
displayed on left side. To use them, press the checkmark button on the right side.
<p>
<h3>Drop Eyes</h3>

It is possible to drop the eyes, so the character has no eyes. Usually eyes will be replaced with a different eyes-mesh, so dropping is usally not needed.
<p>
<h3>Change Information</h3>
Select the eyes before. The asset editor will open. You can now change the information:
<ul>
<li>The photo icon takes a screenshot to be used as a thumbnail. For eyes the thumbnail is created for
the textures with eye-colors, these are replaced, not the icons showing the geometry of the mesh.
Make sure you create a thumbnail of only eye region.
<li>If you want to use own tags, you can either copy tags to tag editor and change the tags there or
create new ones by using the standard tags (recommended for filtering). A standard tag can be
inserted by selecting it from the list and press the plus button.
You can also delete a tag row or delete all tags by pressing the sweep icon.
</ul>
In the end you need to save the asset information.
<p><i>Hint: the tags are saved in the database, the original tags in the files are not changed. The icon
however will replace the old one.</i>
<p>
<h3>Change Material</h3>
To change a material, the item must be selected and it must also be used. It is not possible to change a material for an unused item.
<p>
The material selection then will open. Especially if there are more materials than just one, select
the material you want to use. In the viewport, the mesh will use the selected material. You can also edit
this and either use it or save it (with the same name or also as an additional material).
