<h1>Export a Character</h1>

This context provides the possibility to export a character using different formats
<p>
<i>Characters are usually exported to the <b>exports</b> folder. Inside this folder there are folders
for different base-meshes. So an hm08 character is exported to folder <b>exports/hm08</b></i>.
<p>
A different export folder can be selected. Also the name of the textures folder inside the export folder can be changed.
<p>
In case that the file already exists, the program will ask for a confirmation to overwrite the file.
<h3>Form</h3>
Add or select parameters in the form to be used for export. Some of the parameters are not selectable
because either the file format demands this parameter or does not support the parameter.
<ul>
<li>Enter a filename. A suffix according to file format will always be appended.</li>
<li>Binary mode, if a file format supports a binary mode, it can be selected here. Binary files are usually shorter.</li>
<li>Pack textures into file, if a file format supports embedded textures, it can be selected here. The files are usually larger, but no additional files are needed.</li>
<li>Feet on the ground. The root of the character is near pelvis. This option allows to pose a character on the ground.</li>
<li>Character posed. Load and set a pose in animation before. This pose will be used.</li>
<li>Save hidden vertices. Vertices under clothes are usually not exported, because they might shine
through. If you need these vertices, enable this parameter.</li>
<li>Save animation. Some of the formats allow skeletons, skinning and animation.
You need to load skeleton and an animation before. Pose corrections will be merged.</li>
<li>Save helpers. A feature to export the clothes helper. Rarely needed.</li>
<li>Save normals. Some formats demand or have the possibility of reading normals. Technically they can also be calculated from the mesh itself.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Exporting</h3>

Is done by pressing the export button after selecting the options.
