<h1>Export a Character</h1>

This context provides the possibility to export a character using different formats
<p>
<i>Characters are usually exported to the <b>exports</b> folder. Inside this folder there are the folders<br>
for different base-meshes. So an hm08 character is exported to folder <b>exports/hm08</b></i>.
<p>
It is possible to overwrite existing files.
<h3>Form</h3>
Add or select parameters in the form to be used for export. Some of the parameters are not selectable<br>
because either the file format demands this parameter or does not support the parameter.
<ul>
<li>Enter a filename. A suffix according to file format will always be appended.
<li>Binary mode, if a file format supports a binary mode, it can be selected here. Binary files are<br>
usually shorter.
<li>Feet on the ground. The root of the character is near pelvis. This option allows to pose a character<br>
on the ground.
<li>Character posed. Load and set a pose in animation before. This pose will be used.
<li>Save hidden vertices. Vertices under clothes are usually not saved, because they might shine<br>
through. If you need these vertices, enable this parameter.
<li>Save animation. Some of the formats allow skeletons, skinning and animation.<br>
You need to load an animation before.
<li>Save helpers. A feature to export the clothes helper. Rarely needed.
<li>Save normals. Some formats demand or have the possibility of reading normals.<br>
Technically they can also be calculated from the mesh itself.
</ul>
<h3>Exporting</h3>

Is done by pressing the export button after selecting the options.
