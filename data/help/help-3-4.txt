<h1>Create Expressions</h1>
<p>
This context is used to create own expressions. The expressions are not morphs, they are created
by face bones. A final position of a set of bones was created and you need to decide, how much of this movement is used.
So a "jaw drop" was created in a full open position and you can determine, how much
this position should be used by dragging the slider on the right column.<p>
All slider are one-sided sliders from 0-100 percent.
<p>
<b>To use one of the sliders, click on a icon in the right column, the slider will expand and it is possible
to use different ways to enter the value. There is also a small "sweep" button to reset it to default.</b>
<p>
<i>Best to load a skin texture before changing sliders here, otherwise some of the categories are rarely visible.</i>
<p>
In the end the expression should be saved. It will appear in the "Expressions" module.
It is possible to load existing expression as well.
<p>
<h2>Categories</h2>
The categories are used to modify parts of the face. You need to select the category first.
<p>
<ul>
<li>Eyebrows: you can change left and right brow independently.</li>
<li>Eyelids: you can close or open all four eyelids independently.</li>
<li>Eyes: both eyes can be moved in all directions independently.</li>
<li>Cheeks: cheeks can be changed independently or both cheeks the same time.</li>
<li>Chin: the chin can be moved. Useful as a correction of jaw movement.</li>
<li>Lips: Upper- and lower lips can be changed here in various positions.</li>
<li>Mouth: Jaw and skin movement in mouth region.</li>
<li>Tongue: When a tongue is added, tongue movement can be done here.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<h3>Load and save an expression</h3>
You can load an existent expression by pressing the load button and modify it.
<p>
If you want to save your own expression, it is possible to do a screen shot with the camera icon. Use a name for the expression.
Supply tags if you want or do that later in the asset editor. Save it with the save-button.
