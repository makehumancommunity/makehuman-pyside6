<h1>Equipment, Tongue</h1>

This context provides the possibility to equip the character with a tongue.
<p>
<i>The character is equipped with no tongue per default. Tongue can be used only once and can be replaced by other tongue.</i>
<p>
The currently selected tongue is marked with a yellow frame. A green frame means, that the tongue is used.
<p>
<h3>Filtering</h3>
<ul>
<li>For tongue only the text filter can be used, the text filter works on all tags presented in the <b>Tags</b> field after tongue is selected.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Hint: It is possible to supply a tongue
with extra tags, these tags are then used instead of the tags provided in the tongue files.
<p>
<h3>Attach an asset (tongue)</h3>

To attach an asset, either select it from the right column with a single click. Now the information is
displayed on left side. To put it on the character, press the checkmark button on the right side. A double click on an unselected
asset will attach it as well.
<p>
<h3>Drop Tongue</h3>

It is possible to drop the tongue, so the character has no tongue.
You can also replace the tongue by selecting a different tongue
and press the checkmark button or double-click it.
<p>
<h3>Change Information</h3>
Select the tongue before. The asset editor will open. You can now change the information:
<ul>
<li>Unfortunately it does not make sense to create a screenshot as a thumbnail, in standard position tongue is not visible. Normally the
thumbnail is supplied from a graphics program.</li>
<li>If you want to use own tags, you can either copy tags to tag editor and change the tags there or
create new ones by using the standard tags (recommended for filtering). A standard tag can be
inserted by selecting it from the list and press the plus button.
You can also delete a tag row or delete all tags by pressing the sweep icon.</li>
</ul>
In the end you need to save the asset information.
<p><i>Hint: the tags are saved in the database, the original tags in the files are not changed. The icon
however will replace the old one.</i>
<p>
<h3>Change Material</h3>
To change a material, the item must be selected and it must also be used. It is not possible to change a material for an unused item.
<p>
The material selection then will open. Especially if there are more materials than just one, select
the material you want to use. In the viewport, the mesh will use the selected material. You can also edit
this and either use it or save it (with the same name or also as an additional material).
