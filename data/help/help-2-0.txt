<h1>Equipment, Clothes</h1>

This context provides the possibility to equip the character with clothes.
<p>
<i>The term clothes is not 100% correct, it is possible to append other meshes as well, like bodyparts etc.
Clothes are the only meshes, where multiple items can be used.</i>
<p>
The currently selected piece of clothing is marked with a yellow frame, all other used ones with a green frame.
<p>
<h3>Filtering</h3>
As long as tags are provided, clothes can be filtered in numerous ways. Clothes with no tags are always
shown.  These are the possibilities to filter  on the left side:
<ul>
<li>By expanding the items, like <b>Slot</b>, then  <b>Top-Torso</b>, then <b>Layer 1</b>. The more it gets detailed,
the less icons will be on right side. The top-level items (<b>Gender-Age</b>, <b>Era</b>, <b>Occasion</b>, <b>Slot</b>) work
like 'and', so you can select Layer 2 clothes like <b>Sweater</b> only for females. Sublayers
are combined with 'or', so clicking on <b>Tanktop</b> in <b>Layer 1</b> and <b>Shirt</b> in <b>Layer 2</b> will
present shirts and tanktops.</li>
<p>
<li>By clicking on an icon below the selection. These icons create a combined filter. So the lingerie
item activates gender <b>Female</b> and <b>Bra</b> from <b>Top-Torso</b> <b>Layer 1</b> with additional <b>Panties</b>
from <b>Bottom</b> <b>Layer 1</b></li>
<p>
<li>By using a text filter, the text filter works on all tags presented in the <b>Tags</b> field after a
piece of clothing is selected.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Hint: If the program shows too many items on right side, it is possible to supply all clothes
with extra tags, these tags are then used instead of the tags provided in the clothes files.
<p>
<h3>Attach an asset (piece of clothing)</h3>

To attach an asset, either select it from the right column with a single click. Now the information is
displayed on left side. To put it on the character, press the checkmark button on the right side. A double click on an unselected
asset will attach it as well.
<p>
<h3>Drop Clothes</h3>

Either only the selected piece of clothing or all currently used clothes can be dropped using the buttons on the top
of the right column. Also a double click on an attached piece of clothing will drop the asset.
<p>
<h3>Change Information</h3>
Select the piece of clothing before. The asset editor will open. You can now change the information:
<ul>
<li>The photo icon takes a screenshot to be used as a thumbnail. Best to switch off skybox (the globe)
and use a one-colored background. Under "<u>S</u>ettings" change light and scene and select a
background color with contrast.</li>
<li>If you want to use own tags, you can either copy tags to tag editor and change the tags there or
create new ones by using the standard tags (recommended for filtering). A standard tag can be
inserted by selecting it from the list and press the plus button.
You can also delete a tag row or delete all tags by pressing the sweep icon.</li>
</ul>
In the end you need to save the asset information.
<p><i>Hint: the tags are saved in the database, the original tags in the files are not changed. The icon
however will replace the old one.</i>
<p>
<h3>Change Material</h3>
To change a material, the item must be selected and it also must be used. It is not possible to change a material for an unused item.
<p>
The material selection then will open. Especially if there are more materials than just one, select
the material you want to use. In the viewport, the mesh will use the selected material. You can also edit
this and either use it or save it (with the same name or also as an additional material).
