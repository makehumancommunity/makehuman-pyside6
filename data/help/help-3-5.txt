<h1>Create Poses</h1>
<p>
This context is used to create own poses and also to add corrections for animations. The poses are not morphs, they are created
by bones. A final position of a set of bones was created and you need to decide, how much of this movement is used.
So a "Head tilt" was created in a full left and right position and you can determine, how much
this position should be used by dragging the slider on the right column.<p>
Some sliders are one-sided sliders from 0-100 percent, most are double-sided and use -100 to 100 percent.
<p>
<b>To use one of the sliders, click on a icon in the right column, the slider will expand and it is possible
to use different ways to enter the value. There is also a small "sweep" button to reset it to default.</b>
<p>
In the end the poses should be saved. It will appear in the "Poses" module. These poses are not bvh files.
It is possible to load existing poses as well (only mhpose files).
<p>
<h2>Categories</h2>
The categories are used to modify parts of the character. You need to select the category first.
<p>
<ul>
<li>Root: used to change the character root.</li>
<li>Head: head can be rotated in all directions independently.</li>
<li>Left-arm: upper arm rotates in two directions and can be twisted, lower arm can only rotate in one direction.</li>
<li>Right-arm: works in analogy to left arm.</li>
<li>Left-hand: hands can rotate in two directions and lower arm can be twisted to rotate hand according to bone-axis as well.</li>
<li>Right-hand: works in analogy to left hand.</li>
<li>Body: upper and lower body can be rotate in all directions.</li>
<li>Left-leg: upper leg rotates in two directions and can be twisted, lower leg can only rotate in one direction. Foot can rotate in two directions and can be twisted.</li>
<li>Right-leg:  works in analogy to left leg.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Load and save an poses</h3>
You can load an existent poses (only .mhpose files) by pressing the load button and modify it.
<p>
If you want to save your own pose, it is possible to do a screen shot with the camera icon. Use a name for the pose.
Supply tags if you want or do that later in the asset editor. Save it with the save-button.
