<h1>Makehuman2 File System</h1>
<p>
Makehuman uses two locations to read or write data. The system location, which is where the program is installed and
a user location which can be changed in preferences (a later change will demand to move the data as well).
Both locations are checked, when files need to be loaded.
<p>
The data is organized in different asset categories (like clothes and hair), then a mesh sub-directory is the next layer, except for those cases,
where the mesh does not make sense.

<i>Hint: as long as there is no different mesh, the sub-directory is mostly hm08, other sub-directories for test-purposes are simply empty.
Adding a new base mesh in user space is possible, but until now not yet tested, since also special JSON files must be placed there, which
would be used for selection criteria etc.</i>
