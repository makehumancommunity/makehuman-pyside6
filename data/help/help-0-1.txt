<h1>Load a Character</h1>

This context provides the possibility to load a character from a file.
<p>
<i>Characters are usually saved in the <b>models</b> folder. Inside this folder there are the folders<br>
for different base-meshes. So an hm08 character is saved in folder <b>models/hm08</b></i>.
<p>
Loading a new character will replace the old one, which might be already changed before, in this<br>
case the program will ask you if you want to save the existing character before.
<p>
<h3>Filtering</h3>

To select a character, you can use a filter with some predefined values, like gender, era and genre.<br>
As long as the characters are tagged with these attributes, they will be shown.<br>
Characters with no attributes are always shown. You can:
<ul>
<li>select from the attributes
<li>click on a filter icon
<li>or enter a text in the filter box
</ul>
Hint: If the program shows too many characters on right side, load and save the non-fitting characters<br>
with the appropriate tags set.
<p>
<h3>Loading</h3>

Select a character from the right side. Be aware it is not yet loaded, but the information is displayed on<br>
