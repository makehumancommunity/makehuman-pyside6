<h1>Load a Character</h1>

This context provides the possibility to load a character from a file. It is also possible to load just the targets
(morphs) or just the head-targets. This can be used to exchange geometry.
<p>
<i>Characters are usually saved in the <b>models</b> folder. Inside this folder there are the folders
for different base-meshes. So an hm08 character is saved in folder <b>models/hm08</b></i>.
<p>
Loading a new character will replace the old one, which might be already changed before, in this
case the program will ask you if you want to save the existing character before.
<p>
<h3>Filtering</h3>

To select a character, you can use a filter with some predefined values, like gender, era and genre.
As long as the characters are tagged with these attributes, they will be shown.
Characters with no attributes are always shown. You can:
<ul>
<li>select from the attributes</li>
<li>click on a filter icon</li>
<li>or enter a text in the filter box</li>
</ul>
Hint: If the program shows too many characters on right side, load and save the non-fitting characters
with the appropriate tags set.
<p>
<h3>Loading</h3>

Select a character from the right side. Be aware it is not yet loaded, but the information is displayed on
left side. Decide if to load the complete character, only the targets or just the head-targets.
To load, press the checkmark on the right side.
<p>
<i>Hint: "head-pattern" in base.json will determine which groups are considered as head.
For official targets it is "face|", but also certain user groups like "user|nose" are accepted.
If "head-pattern" is missing, the program uses all targets.</i>
