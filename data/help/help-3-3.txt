<h1>Pose and Animation, Expressions</h1>

This context provides the possibility to add a facial expression to a character.
If a pose or animation was loaded, the character will be presented in pose mode.
<p>
The currently selected expression is marked with a yellow frame. A green frame means, that the expression is used.
<p>
<h3>Filtering</h3>
As long as tags are provided, expressions can be filtered in different ways. Expressions with no tags are always
shown.  These are the possibilities to filter on the left side:
<ul>
<li>By expanding an item like <b>positive</b>, then select a type.</li>
<p>
<li>By using a text filter, the text filter works on all tags presented in the <b>Tags</b> field after a expression is selected.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Hint: If the program shows too many items on right side, it is possible to supply a expression
with extra tags, these tags are then used instead of the tags provided in the expression files.
<p>
<h3>Loading</h3>

Select a expression from the right side. Be aware it is not yet loaded, only the information is
displayed on left side. To load it, press the checkmark button on the right side.
<p>
<h3>Drop Expression</h3>

It is possible to drop the expression or simply select another expression and replace old one.
<p>
<h3>Change Information</h3>
Select the expression before. The asset editor will open. You can now change the information:
<ul>
<li>The photo icon takes a screenshot to be used as a thumbnail. Best to switch off skybox (the globe)
and use a one-colored background. Under "<u>S</u>ettings" change light and scene and select a
background color with contrast.</li>
<li>If you want to use own tags, you can either copy tags to tag editor and change the tags there or
create new ones by using the standard tags (recommended for filtering). A standard tag can be
inserted by selecting it from the list and press the plus button.
You can also delete a tag row or delete all tags by pressing the sweep icon.</li>
</ul>
In the end you need to save the asset information.
<p><i>Hint: the tags are saved in the database, the original tags in the files are not changed. The icon
however will replace the old one.</i>
