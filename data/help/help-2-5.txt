<h1>Equipment, Teeth</h1>

This context provides the possibility to equip the character with teeth.
<p>
<i>The character is equipped with no teeth per default. Teeth can be used only once and can be replaced by other teeth.</i>
<p>
The currently selected teeth are marked with a yellow frame. A green frame means, that the teeth are used.
<p>
<h3>Filtering</h3>
<ul>
<li>For teeth only the text filter can be used, the text filter works on all tags presented in the <b>Tags</b> field after teeth are selected.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Hint: It is possible to supply teeth
with extra tags, these tags are then used instead of the tags provided in the teeth files.
<p>
<h3>Loading</h3>

Select teeth from the right side. Be aware it is not yet loaded, only the information is
displayed on left side. To use them, press the checkmark button on the right side.
<p>
<h3>Drop Teeth</h3>

It is possible to drop the teeth, so the character has no teeth.
You can also replace the teeth by selecting different teeth
and press the checkmark button.
<p>
<h3>Change Information</h3>
Select the teeth before. The asset editor will open. You can now change the information:
<ul>
<li>Unfortunately it does not make sense to create a screenshot as a thumbnail, in standard position teeth are not visible. Normally the
thumbnail is supplied from a graphics program.</li>
<li>If you want to use own tags, you can either copy tags to tag editor and change the tags there or
create new ones by using the standard tags (recommended for filtering). A standard tag can be
inserted by selecting it from the list and press the plus button.
You can also delete a tag row or delete all tags by pressing the sweep icon.</li>
</ul>
In the end you need to save the asset information.
<p><i>Hint: the tags are saved in the database, the original tags in the files are not changed. The icon
however will replace the old one.</i>
<p>
<h3>Change Material</h3>
To change a material, the item must be selected and it must also be used. It is not possible to change a material for an unused item.
<p>
The material selection then will open. Especially if there are more materials than just one, select
the material you want to use. In the viewport, the mesh will use the selected material. You can also edit
this and either use it or save it (with the same name or also as an additional material).
