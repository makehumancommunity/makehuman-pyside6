<h1>Pose and Animation, Poses</h1>

This context provides the possibility to load a single pose or a complete animation.
If a pose or animation was loaded, the character will be presented in pose mode.
Poses can be mhpose files, which can be created inside MakeHuman (one frame only) or bvh files.
<p>
The currently selected pose or animation is marked with a yellow frame. A green frame means, that the pose is used.
<p>
<h3>Filtering</h3>
As long as tags are provided, poses can be filtered in different ways. Poses with no tags are always
shown.  These are the possibilities to filter on the left side:
<ul>
<li>By expanding an item like <b>activity</b>, then select a type.</li>
<p>
<li>By using a text filter, the text filter works on all tags presented in the <b>Tags</b> field after a pose is selected.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Hint: If the program shows too many items on right side, it is possible to supply a pose or animation
with extra tags, these tags are then used instead of the tags provided in the pose files.
<p>
<h3>Loading</h3>

Select a pose or animation from the right side. Be aware it is not yet loaded, only the information is
displayed on left side. To load it, press the checkmark button on the right side. After loading, the first frame
is showed. For viewing a complete animation, select:
<table style="background-color:#c0c0c0;color:#000000;border:2;vertical-align:middle;"><tr><td><img src="data/icons/an_movie.png"></td></tr></table>
<p>
<h3>Drop Pose/Animation</h3>

It is possible to drop the pose or simply select another pose and replace old one.
<p>
<h3>Change Information</h3>
Select the pose before. The asset editor will open. You can now change the information:
<ul>
<li>The photo icon takes a screenshot to be used as a thumbnail. Best to switch off skybox (the globe)
and use a one-colored background. Under "<u>S</u>ettings" change light and scene and select a
background color with contrast.</li>
<li>If you want to use own tags, you can either copy tags to tag editor and change the tags there or
create new ones by using the standard tags (recommended for filtering). A standard tag can be
inserted by selecting it from the list and press the plus button.
You can also delete a tag row or delete all tags by pressing the sweep icon.</li>
</ul>
In the end you need to save the asset information.
<p><i>Hint: the tags are saved in the database, the original tags in the files are not changed. The icon
however will replace the old one.</i>
