<h1>Render the Character</h1>

This context provides a possibility to render the character. This module allows a better quality, if you have
no possibility to use e.g. Blender. Be aware, this will never be as perfect as in a ray-trace system, but it might be a help
for those using the character as an image to be inserted in a normal paint program.
<p>
<i>An existing cube-map as a background is not used, the character will always be rendered on a single-colored background,
the color is defined in the scene settings or on a transparent layer.</i>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Select the width and height of the picture.</li>
<li>Decide if you want to render on a transparent canvas.</li>
<li>If the character was posed with an animation, select if you want to render it in posed position.</li>
<li>If the animation is longer than one frame, select the frame you want to render by using the slider.</li>
<li>You can smooth the character. The loop algorithm is used, since the character in MakeHuman works on a triangle base.</i>
You have to smooth again, if you change pose mode or frame number.</li>
<li>When the render is finished, save it to a file by pushing the save-button.</li>
</ul>
