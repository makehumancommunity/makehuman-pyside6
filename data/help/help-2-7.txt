<h1>Equipment, Proxy</h1>

This context provides the possibility to use a proxy instead of the basemesh. This is normally needed, when you need
a simpler basemesh (low-poly version) or need a mesh with gender attributes. Also special meshes can be used, e.g.
a proxy with only a head and the rest will be equipped as clothes to create a robot.
<p>
<i>A proxy can only be used once and can be replaced by another proxy.</i>
<p>
The currently selected proxy is marked with a yellow frame. A green frame means, that the proxy is used.
<p>
<h3>Filtering</h3>
As long as tags are provided, proxies can be filtered in numerous ways. Proxies with no tags all always
shown.  These are the possibilities to filter  on the left side:
<ul>
<li>By expanding the item <b>Gender-Age</b>, then select a gender.</li>
<p>
<li>By clicking on an icon below the selection. There are only two icons, one for males and one for females.</li>
<p>
<li>By using a text filter, the text filter works on all tags presented in the <b>Tags</b> field after a proxy is selected.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Hint: If the program shows too many items on right side, it is possible to supply a proxy
with extra tags, these tags are then used instead of the tags provided in the proxy files.
<p>
<h3>Attach an asset (proxy)</h3>

To attach an asset, either select it from the right column with a single click. Now the information is
displayed on left side. To put it on the character, press the checkmark button on the right side. A double click on an unselected
asset will attach it as well.
<p>
<h3>Drop Proxy</h3>

It is possible to drop the proxy, so the character is displayed in the original way or simply select another proxy and replace old one.
<p>
<h3>Change Information</h3>
Select the proxy before. The asset editor will open. You can now change the information:
<ul>
<li>The photo icon takes a screenshot to be used as a thumbnail. Best to switch off skybox (the globe)
and use a one-colored background. Under "<u>S</u>ettings" change light and scene and select a
background color with contrast. Then maybe change the mesh to wireframe.</li>
<li>If you want to use own tags, you can either copy tags to tag editor and change the tags there or
create new ones by using the standard tags (recommended for filtering). A standard tag can be
inserted by selecting it from the list and press the plus button.
You can also delete a tag row or delete all tags by pressing the sweep icon.</li>
</ul>
In the end you need to save the asset information.
<p><i>Hint: the tags are saved in the database, the original tags in the files are not changed. The icon
however will replace the old one.</i>
