<h1>Pose and Animation, Rigs</h1>

This context provides the possibility to add a skeleton or rig to the character. MakeHuman works with an own
standard skeleton which is always present. So even without a skeleton it is possible to pose or animate
the character. Nevertheless for an export into another system a skeleton is needed.
<p>
<i>A skeleton can only be used once and can be replaced by another skeleton.</i>
<p>
The currently selected skeleton is marked with a yellow frame. A green frame means, that the skeleton is used.
<p>
<h3>Filtering</h3>
As long as tags are provided, skeleton can be filtered in different ways. Skeletons with no tags all always
shown.  These are the possibilities to filter  on the left side:
<ul>
<li>By expanding the item <b>Skeleton</b>, then select a type.</li>
<p>
<li>By using a text filter, the text filter works on all tags presented in the <b>Tags</b> field after a skeleton is selected.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Hint: If the program shows too many items on right side, it is possible to supply a skeleton
with extra tags, these tags are then used instead of the tags provided in the skeleton files.
<p>
<h3>Loading</h3>

Select a skeleton from the right side. Be aware it is not yet loaded, only the information is
displayed on left side. To load it, press the checkmark button on the right side.
<p>
<h3>Drop Skeleton</h3>

It is possible to drop the skeleton or simply select another skeleton and replace old one.
<p>
<h3>Change Information</h3>
Select the skeleton before. The asset editor will open. You can now change the information:
<ul>
<li>The photo icon takes a screenshot to be used as a thumbnail. Best to switch off skybox (the globe)
and use a one-colored background. Under "<u>S</u>ettings" change light and scene and select a
background color with contrast. Best to switch it skeleton view before.</li>
<li>If you want to use own tags, you can either copy tags to tag editor and change the tags there or
create new ones by using the standard tags (recommended for filtering). A standard tag can be
inserted by selecting it from the list and press the plus button.
You can also delete a tag row or delete all tags by pressing the sweep icon.</li>
</ul>
In the end you need to save the asset information.
<p><i>Hint: the tags are saved in the database, the original tags in the files are not changed. The icon
however will replace the old one.</i>
