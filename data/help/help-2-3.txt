<h1>Equipment, Eyebrows</h1>

This context provides the possibility to equip the character with eyebrows.
<p>
<i>The character is equipped with no eyebrows per default. Eyebrows can be used only once and can be replaced by another pair of eyebrows.</i>
<p>
The currently selected eyebrows are marked with a yellow frame. A green frame means, that the eyebrows are used.
<p>
<h3>Filtering</h3>
<ul>
<li>For eyebrows only the text filter can be used, the text filter works on all tags presented in the <b>Tags</b> field after eyebrows are selected.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Hint: It is possible to supply eyebrows
with extra tags, these tags are then used instead of the tags provided in the eyebrows files.
<p>
<h3>Loading</h3>

Select eyebrows from the right side. Be aware it is not yet loaded, only the information is
displayed on left side. To use them, press the checkmark button on the right side.
<p>
<h3>Drop Eyebrows</h3>

It is possible to drop the eyebrows, so the character has no eyebrows.
You can also replace the eyebrows by selecting a new pair of eyebrows
and press the checkmark button.
<p>
<h3>Change Information</h3>
Select the eyebrows before. The asset editor will open. You can now change the information:
<ul>
<li>The photo icon takes a screenshot to be used as a thumbnail. Best do that on a small section of your image, where only eyes and eyebrows are visible.</li>
<li>If you want to use own tags, you can either copy tags to tag editor and change the tags there or
create new ones by using the standard tags (recommended for filtering). A standard tag can be
inserted by selecting it from the list and press the plus button.
You can also delete a tag row or delete all tags by pressing the sweep icon.</li>
</ul>
In the end you need to save the asset information.
<p><i>Hint: the tags are saved in the database, the original tags in the files are not changed. The icon
however will replace the old one.</i>
<p>
<h3>Change Material</h3>
To change a material, the item must be selected and it must also be used. It is not possible to change a material for an unused item.
<p>
The material selection then will open. Especially if there are more materials than just one, select
the material you want to use. In the viewport, the mesh will use the selected material. You can also edit
this and either use it or save it (with the same name or also as an additional material).
