<h1>Modify character</h1>
<!--Screenshot:screenshot/modifycharacter.png-->
<p>
This context is used to model the character. The mesh will be morphed. It is used for all different
categories. Morphing means to move certain vertices of a mesh to a new position (the target).
By using the sliders on the right column, you can determine how much the morph is used.<p>
There are one-sided sliders from 0-100 percent, but also combined sliders, which decrease and increase
the value in the range from -100 to +100 percent.
<p>
<b>To use one of the sliders, click on a icon in the right column, the slider will expand and it is possible
to use different ways to enter the value. There is also a small "sweep" button to reset it to default.</b>
<p>
<h2>Categories</h2>
The categories are used to modify either the complete character or only parts of it. You need
to select the category first.
<p>
<h3>Main category ("macro")</h3>
<ul>
<li>The Gender slider is used to define the gender of the character. Male or female or a mixture of
both characteristics are possible.</li>
<li>The Age slider is used to alter the age of the character. Interally different morphs from baby
to an old person are used.</li>
<li>The Muscle sider is used to adjust the amount of muscle of the character.</li>
<li>The Weight silder is used to adjust the weight of the character. The default setting is the
character with average weight. Used along with “Muscle” it can be used to specify the proportion
of muscle and fat contributing to the weight.</li>
<li>The Height slider is used to adjust the height of the characters.</li>
<li>The Proportions slider is used to adjust the the proportions, from “uncommon” to “idealistic”.</li>
<li>The ethinicity slider is a triangle slider with the values: African, Asian, Caucasian.
The influence of each phenotype can be adjusted.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Body Shapes</h3>
Makehuman uses common expressions for different bodyshapes, like "apple" or "diamond". It is an
easy way to modify the body. There are different forms for males and females. Also a sub-category
with hormonal components is available.
<p>
<h3>Face</h3>
Face modifiers in makehuman are organised into several sub-categories (eyes, nose, chin etc.). Each
detail can be changed separately. Usually you should start with the head shape and size and
then continue with the details.
<p>
<h3>Torso, Arm, Legs</h3>
Torso contains all different features to change the torso (shape, hip, stomach etc.).
Arms contain shoulder, arm and hand (left and right separately).
Legs contain a common size and leg and foot with left and right modifier each.
<p>
<h3>Gender</h3>
Gender has options to modify female breast and male genital. For male genital a proxy must be
activated, otherwise nothing will be shown.
<p>
<h3>Measure</h3>
With measure the typical parameters like bust circum, band size etc. can be changed.
The character indicates the changed area graphically.
<p>
<i>These values can also be shown by using "character info" from information menu. You will get
an extra window. In this window cup sizes will be shown, when your character is "mostly female".
However: For a realistic value set horizontal distance of breast to approx -50%.</i>
<p>
<h3>User</h3>
Own modifications (or "targets") are placed in this user category. This will happen, when
targets are downloaded from makehuman page. Sub-categories are created when the target is
placed in a sub-folder of the user target folder (so like "targets/hm08/head_detail").
<p>
